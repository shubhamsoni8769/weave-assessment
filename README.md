Implement the cart functionality for Fred's Diner.

An image of the required design:
![Completed Cart!](complete-reference.png "Completed Cart")

Requirements:

1. Follow the requested design in the image referenced above.
2. The cart should be empty by default.
3. Items are added to the cart with you click on a MenuItem
4. Once items are in the cart, each row should show an image, the quantity, and the subtotal for that item.
5. The cart should show the total of all items in the cart and the total price of the cart.
6. When the order is placed, just alert the user it is complete, and clear the cart.

Fix anything you find that you fill should be refactored.

Be ready to discuss all of your choices and how things work.
